# Password Generator Exercise

In this exercise, you will implement a simple password generator in Rust. The
password generator should allow users to specify the length and complexity of
the password, and should generate a random password that meets these criteria.

## Functional Requirements

The password generator should support the following operations:

1. Generate a new password. The user should be prompted to enter the desired
   length and complexity of the password, and the program should generate a
   random password that meets these criteria.

2. Copy the password to the system clipboard. After generating a password, the
   program should offer the user the option to copy the password to the system
   clipboard.

## Technical Requirements

1. Use Rust to implement the password generator. You may use any external crates
   that are available on crates.io.

2. Use a cryptographically secure random number generator to generate the
   passwords. Do not use a non-cryptographic random number generator (such as
   the `rand` crate's `Rng` trait) to generate passwords.

3. Use Git to manage your source code and version history. Create a new Git
   repository for your project and commit your changes frequently. When you are
   finished, push your code to a remote repository on a Git hosting service
   (such as GitHub or GitLab).

## Deliverables

1. A working implementation of the password generator that meets the functional
   and technical requirements described above.

2. A `README.md` file that includes instructions for building and running the
   password generator, as well as any other relevant information about the
   project.

3. A Git repository containing the source code and version history of the
   project.

## Evaluation Criteria

Your submission will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

1. Correctness and completeness of the implementation. Does the password
   generator work correctly and meet all of the functional and technical
   requirements?

2. Code quality and organization. Is the code well-structured, easy to read and
   understand, and free of unnecessary complexity?

3. Use of Rust best practices and idioms. Does the code follow Rust best
   practices and idioms, and make good use of Rust language features and
   constructs?

4. Git usage. Is the Git repository well-organized and easy to navigate? Are
   commits frequent and well-documented? Is there evidence of good use of Git
   branching and merging?

## Time Limit

You should aim to complete this exercise within 8 hours. If you are unable to
complete all of the requirements within the time limit, please submit your work
as-is and include a note explaining which parts you were unable to complete and
why.

Good luck! If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us.
